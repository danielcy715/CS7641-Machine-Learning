All the analysis are done in Weka GUI. For data preprocessing, resample and removepecentage filter
is used with no replacement option to 70-30 split the original dataset to training data and test data.
10, 20, 30, ...,90% of the training data is generated by removepencetage filter. Training and test results can be
accessed by Weka explorer and experiment. J48 is used for decision tree. IBK is used for K-nearest neighbor. AdaboostM1 is used 
for boosting. LibSVM is used for SVM. Multilayerpeceptron is used for ANN. Learning curve results are generated by Weka experiment and plot
by Microsoft Office Excel. 

Results spreadsheet and accuracy table for different classifiers are in the folder. Two datasets are also included.
