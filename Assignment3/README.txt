The experiment is run in Weka and Scikit-Learn.
Use the python files to run the clustering analysis.
Use java code to run the dimensionality reduction analysis, which runs J48 with forward search: adding lower ranking components one by one.
The dataset are attached.
Use weka GUI to do PCA, ICA, Random Projection and Information Gain. Use the filter to get transformed the data.
Save the data to arff and csv files to feed to java code or python code to do dimensionality reduction analysis and clustering analysis.
